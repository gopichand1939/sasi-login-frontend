              Long before cities and machines, the Earth was a canvas of pure wilderness â€” ancient forests teeming with life.
              The first man walked barefoot among giants of wood, listened to the roars of tigers, and watched birds trace stories in the sky.
              Nature was not just a home, but a teacher. Every tree, river, and breeze whispered survival, balance, and wisdom.
